<h2>Brief Description of our project</h2>

<img src="/images/contour.png" alt="Loading" title="Loading" class="center" />

<p style="text-align:justify">Welcome to our interactive Black Hole photography and lightlike geodesics simulator. This project was developed for the McGill Physics Hackathon 2022! Here we have implemented massless particles propagation simulations around a Schwarszchild Black Hole, following what can be found in the literature, and we combined it with a simple and intuitive inferface built with PyQT5.
