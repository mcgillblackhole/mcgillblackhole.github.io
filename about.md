## Hello!
<p style="text-align:justify">I'm João Valeriano. I've just finished my Bachelor in Physics by Universidade de Brasília (<a href="https://unb.br/">UnB</a>), Brazil, and started pursuing a Physics Master Degree at Instituto de Física Teórica (<a href="https://www.ift.unesp.br/">IFT-Unesp</a>), São Paulo, Brazil, where <a href="https://ictp-saifr.org">ICTP-SAIFR</a> is based. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">During my Master degree, I expect to better understand how environmental chaotic flows shape microbial social interactions, considering the problem mainly through numerical simulations of models combining dynamical systems (for the chaotic flow) and stochastic processes (for the diffusion of the microbes and its chemical products) techniques. I hope to have some interesting material about it available here soon.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My Bachelor in Physics degree started in 2016 and, through its duration, I worked on different year-long projects at UnB, approaching themes including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quantum Chaos characterization;</li>
<li>Phased array simulations for radio astronomy;</li>
<li>Ferrofluid Monte Carlo simulations.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <p style="text-align:justify">In 2018, I've participated on a two-week intensive research project with 7 other physics students at <a href="https://portal.cbpf.br/en-us/home/">CBPF</a>, where we developed and characterized a Josephson Junction. Also, in 2019, I was a student in the two-month long <a href="https://pages.cnpem.br/bolsasdeverao/">CNPEM Summer Grants Program</a>, during which I worked at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (<a href="https://www.lnls.cnpem.br/en/">LNLS</a>), developing instrumentation for electrocaloric and electrostrictive effects.</p> -->

<p>I graduated in 2020, with an <a href="../publications#tcc">Undergraduate Dissertation</a> focused on discrete time linear stochastic processes. Our main result was to show when to expect the gaussianization of the limit distribution, based on the system's eigenvalues.</p>
